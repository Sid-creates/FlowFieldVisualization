Flow Field
An grid over an area with each division given a vector
Particles are placed over the field and motion is animated
motion is influenced by the current box
I think making the particle Acc rather than fully take the box as V is better
Particle trails and effects lead to desired visual effect
Can I caluculate a visual feild onclick and modify generated vectors thickness with mouse hover or animated motion
